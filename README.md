# Nuxt LinkTree
This web app is a platform that allows users to create and share their own lists of their top 20 items in various categories such as songs, movies, or anime. The technology stack used for building this app includes Nuxt.js version 3, Supabase, Prisma, and Tailwind CSS. Users can log in and create their own lists, which are stored in a database and can be publicly shared with other users.
